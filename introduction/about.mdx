Squid Academy is a **role-based learning and competition platform** for schools, teams, and partners. We combine an LMS for day-to-day teaching and learning with a tournaments system for events and leagues—all under one account.

Our docs are organized by **role** (Org Admins, Teachers, Students, Partners/Resellers, Team Captains, Players, Tournament Admins) so each person can get exactly what they need.
