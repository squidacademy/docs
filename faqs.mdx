## Accounts & Access

**Who creates my account?**  
- **Org Admins** are created by a **Partner** or **Reseller**.  
- **Teachers/Students** are created by the **Org Admin** (your school).  
If you don’t have access yet, ask your school admin first.

**I forgot my password. What do I do?**  
Use **Forgot Password** on the sign-in page, or ask your admin to reset it.

**I can’t see my organization / classes.**  
You’re likely not assigned yet. Ask your Org Admin to add you to the right org/class; then log out and back in.

## LMS (Classes, Courses, Progress)

**How do we create classes and add people?**  
Org Admins: go to **Classes → Add Class**, assign a teacher, pick modules/courses, then add students. See [Org Admins](/user-guides/org-admins).

**Can teachers add students to a class?**  
If your school enables it, teachers can add students from the class **Edit** screen. Otherwise, ask the Org Admin.

**How do we control lesson pacing?**  
Enable/disable chapters in the class **Edit** screen (if your school allows teacher control).

**A student finished a lesson but it didn’t “complete.”**  
Have them reopen the lesson and click **Finish/Complete**, then refresh. If it still doesn’t show, the teacher/admin can check progress from the class page.

**Can we edit course content?**  
You can select which modules/chapters are active. Course content itself is managed centrally.

## Tournaments

**How do I create a team?**  
Team Captains: go to the tournament area, **Create Team**, set the name/logo, then invite players. See [Team Captains](/user-guides/team-captains).

**How do we register for an event?**  
Open the event page and **Register Team**. Make sure your roster meets the event requirements.

**Who reports scores?**  
Captains report scores on the match page. Attach proof if requested. Admins resolve disputes.

**A wrong score was reported—what now?**  
Contact a Tournament Admin immediately with evidence (screenshots, VOD). They’ll correct results per the rules.

Create organizations and (optionally) appoint resellers from the Partner console. See [Partners](/user-guides/partners).

**Can an existing organization become a reseller?**  
Yes—your Partner can convert an existing org or create a separate reseller account and keep the original org for teaching. See [Partners](/user-guides/partners) or contact support.
