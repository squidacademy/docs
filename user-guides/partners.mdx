## Overview

Partners oversee a whole region or portfolio of organizations either by themselves or by appointing Resellers, who have the same powers as a partner but for their designated region like creating and managing organizations (schools, universities, lan centers, etc.), assigning **Org Admins,** **number of students, teachers and classes** as well as choosing which **courses** each org gets, and of course keeping an eye on overall usage. If needed can create **users** (Org Admins, Teachers, Students) on behalf of an organization as well.

## Getting Started

- Log in to access your **Admin Console** (you’ll see admin menus like Dashboard, Partner Console (contains Resellers (can edit), Organizations (can edit), Classess (view-only), Teachers (view-only) and Students (view-only)) Organizations, Users, Classes, etc.).

## FAQs

- **I can’t create another Partner.** That’s expected—only platform owners do that.
- **Org Admin can’t see their school.** Edit the school and make sure the correct Org Admin is assigned; then have them log out/in.
- **Where do I change courses for a school?** Edit the school in **Organizations** and toggle modules/chapters there.
- **Deleting vs. deactivating?** Prefer **deactivate** (if available). Deleting removes access and may archive data.
