## Overview

**Partners** manage a region or portfolio of **organizations** and may appoint **Resellers** to manage a subset of those orgs. As a Partner you can create and manage **Organizations** (schools, universities, LAN centers), assign **Org Admins**, set quotas (max students/teachers/classes), enable **modules/courses**, and monitor usage. You can also create users (Org Admins, Teachers, Students) on an organization’s behalf when needed.

<Callout type="info">
**Organization** = a school, university, LAN center, or similar entity under your management.  
**Reseller** = a partner you authorize to manage a subset of your organizations.
</Callout>

## Getting started

- Your **Partner** account is created for you (or your existing user is upgraded to Partner after approval).
- Log in to access the **Admin Console**, which typically includes:
  - **Dashboard** — high-level stats across your region.
  - **Partner Console** — manage **Resellers** and **Organizations**; view **Classes**, **Teachers**, **Students**.
  - **Account → Users** — create users and assign roles (Reseller, Org Admin, Teacher, Student).

## What you can do

- Create and manage **Resellers**.  
- Create and manage **Organizations** (schools, universities, LAN centers, etc.).  
- Assign **Org Admins** to organizations.  
- Control which **modules/courses** each organization can use.  
- (Optional) Create users for an org (**Org Admins**, **Teachers**, **Students**).  
- Monitor usage across resellers and organizations.

5. Select the **modules/courses** the org can access.  
6. Click **Submit**.

### Assign or add an Org Admin (later)
1. Go to **Organizations**, find the org → **Edit**.  
2. In **Admins**, add the user (or create them under **Account → Users** with **Role = Org Admin**).  
3. Save.

1. Go to **Organizations**, find the org → **Edit**.  
2. Update quotas, Org Admins, and available modules/courses (and chapters if applicable).

## FAQs

- **Can I create another Partner?**  
  No. Only platform owners can create Partner accounts.

- **An Org Admin can’t see their organization.**  
  Open **Organizations → Edit** and ensure they’re assigned. Have them sign out and back in.

- **Where do I change modules/courses for an organization?**  
  In **Organizations → Edit** under the modules/courses section for that org.

- **Delete vs. deactivate?**  
  Prefer **Deactivate** (if available) to preserve history. **Delete** removes access and may archive data.
