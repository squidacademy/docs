## Overview

Partners manage a region or portfolio of organizations. You can work directly or appoint **Resellers** (who manage a subset of your orgs). As a Partner you can create and manage organizations (schools, universities, LAN centers), assign **Org Admins**, set quotas (max students/teachers/classes), enable **modules/courses**, and monitor usage. If needed, you can also create users (Org Admins, Teachers, Students) on an organization’s behalf.

## Getting Started

- Your Partner account is created for you, or your existing user is upgraded to Partner after approval.
- Log in to access the **Admin Console**. You’ll typically see:
  - **Dashboard** (high-level stats)
  - **Partner Console:** Resellers (edit), Organizations (edit), Classes (view-only), Teachers (view-only), Students (view-only)
  - **Account → Users** Create resellers and org admins; in special cases, add teachers and students on the organization’s behalf.

## FAQs

- **I can’t create another Partner.** That’s expected—only platform owners can create Partner accounts.  
- **An Org Admin can’t see their organization.** Edit the org and make sure the correct Org Admin is assigned, then have them log out/in.  
- **Where do I change courses for an organization?** Open the org in **Organizations → Edit** and toggle modules/chapters there.  
- **Deleting vs. deactivating?** Prefer **Deactivate** (if available). Deleting removes access and may archive data.
