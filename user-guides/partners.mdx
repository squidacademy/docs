## Getting Started

- Log in to access the **Admin Console** (you’ll see admin menus like Organizations, Users, Classes, etc.).

## What You Can Do

- Create and manage **Resellers**.
- Create and manage **Organizations** (schools).
- Assign **Org Admins** to schools.
- Control which **modules/courses** each school can use.
- (Optionally) create **users** (Org Admins, Teachers, Students) on behalf of a school.
- View high-level stats (schools, classes, teachers, students).

## FAQs

- **I can’t create another Partner.** That’s expected—only platform owners do that.
- **Org Admin can’t see their school.** Edit the school and make sure the correct Org Admin is assigned; then have them log out/in.
- **Where do I change courses for a school?** Edit the school in **Organizations** and toggle modules/chapters there.
- **Deleting vs. deactivating?** Prefer **deactivate** (if available). Deleting removes access and may archive data.
