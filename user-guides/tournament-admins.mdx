## FAQs

- **Teams can’t register.** Check that registration is open and team size/eligibility are set correctly.
- **Roster changes after lock.** Decide per rules; admins can override in special cases.
- **Score disputes.** Request evidence from both captains; rule per written policy and keep logs.
- **No-shows.** Apply forfeit rules; document attempts to contact teams.
