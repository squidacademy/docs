## FAQs

- **Can I change course content?** You can toggle modules/chapters, but not edit lesson content itself.
- **Student left the school.** Deactivate rather than delete to preserve history.
- **Deleted a class by accident.** Contact your Reseller/Partner immediately; you can recreate the class, but restoration may require admin support.
