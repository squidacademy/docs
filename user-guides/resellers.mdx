## FAQs

- **I can’t create other Resellers.** Correct—only Partners can.
- **Org Admin doesn’t see their school.** Ensure they’re assigned in the school’s **Edit** screen, then have them re-login.
- **Roster import?** If bulk import isn’t visible, add users individually or ask your Partner for help.
