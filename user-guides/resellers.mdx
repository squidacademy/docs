## FAQs

- **I can’t create other Resellers.**  
  Correct — only **Partners** can create or manage Resellers.

- **An Org Admin can’t see their organization.**  
  In **Organizations → Edit**, make sure they’re assigned to that org. Have them sign out and back in.

- **Can we bulk-import rosters?**  
  If bulk import isn’t available in your workspace, add users individually or ask your **Partner** to enable/import on your behalf.
