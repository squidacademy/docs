Squid Academy retains personal data only for as long as it is needed for the purposes described in our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1pJDPGOXueYFzt81Wzzv25-04_nuPi3seArJJkqm_d_4/edit) and to meet legal, contractual, and operational requirements.

This page summarizes the main retention periods and deletion procedures referenced in Section 12 of our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1pJDPGOXueYFzt81Wzzv25-04_nuPi3seArJJkqm_d_4/edit) and Section 8 of our [<u>Data Processing Addendum</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit).

## **1. Key Principles**

- **Purpose limitation** – We keep personal data only for as long as necessary for the specific purpose it was collected.
- **Legal obligations** – Some data must be retained for statutory reasons (e.g., tax, accounting, or child protection laws).
- **Customer instructions** – For organization-provisioned accounts, we follow the controller’s instructions for retention and deletion under our DPA.
- **Secure deletion** – When data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized.
