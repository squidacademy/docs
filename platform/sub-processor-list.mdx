## **1. Introduction**

Squid Academy uses carefully selected third-party service providers (“Sub-processors”) to support the delivery of our LMS, tournament platform, and related services. These Sub-processors may process personal data on our behalf when providing their services. (For details on our cross-border data protection safeguards, see our [<u>International Data Transfers</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1CyjvkQlK117ZzibQoIzbA9fgCzVihPBzt1vNClSkgiw/edit) page.)

We conduct due diligence before engaging any Sub-processor and require all Sub-processors to enter into written agreements that impose data protection obligations consistent with our [<u>Data Processing Addendum</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit).

## **2. How We Update This List**

- **Advance Notice:** We will update this page at least **30 days before** engaging a new Sub-processor, except where urgent replacement is required (see below).
- **Emergency Replacement:** In urgent cases (e.g., to maintain security, availability, or continuity of service), we may engage a Sub-processor without prior notice. In these cases, we will update this list as soon as reasonably practicable and provide notice promptly.
- **How to Object:** If you are a customer with a current agreement incorporating our [<u>DPA</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit), you may object to a new Sub-processor by emailing [<u>privacy@squid.gg</u>](mailto:privacy@squid.gg) within 30 days of notice. Objections must be based on reasonable, documented grounds relating to data protection risks.
