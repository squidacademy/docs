This guide explains how Squid Academy obtains, verifies, and manages parental or guardian consent when processing the personal data of children under applicable laws (such as COPPA in the United States, UK children’s privacy rules, and GDPR-K in the EU).

## **1. When We Require Parental Consent**

We require verifiable parental consent before collecting, using, or sharing personal data of:

- Children under 13 in the United States (COPPA).
- Children under the age of digital consent in other jurisdictions (varies by country, usually 13–16).
- Where required by a customer organization’s local laws or school policies.

## **2. Who is Responsible**

- **For public accounts**: Squid Academy collects and verifies parental consent directly.
- **For organization-provisioned accounts**: The school, university, or esports center acts as the data controller and is responsible for obtaining parental consent. Squid Academy assists by providing consent tools, templates, and guidance.

## **3. How We Obtain Consent**

Depending on the law and context, we may use:

- **Digital signature forms** (sent via secure link).
- **Credit card/online payment verification** (with nominal refundable charge).
- **Government-issued ID check** (parent uploads ID to secure channel).
- **Signed paper consent forms** (returned via scan or post).
- **School-mediated consent** (controller provides documented proof to Squid Academy).

## **4. Verification Process**

- We verify that the person providing consent is the child’s parent or legal guardian.
- We record the date, method, and proof of consent in our compliance log.
- Consent records are retained as long as the child’s account is active, plus 12 months after closure.

## **5. Revoking Consent**

Parents/guardians can revoke consent at any time by:

- Using our [<u>Privacy Request Form</u>](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IwxaKEtOAeDeaGgC6E3I_nLwY4zKsBp2XVnW1S_0gew).
- Emailing [<u>privacy@squid.gg</u>](mailto:privacy@squid.gg) with the child’s name, username, and school/organization (if applicable). When consent is revoked, the child’s account is suspended or deleted, depending on the request.

## **6. Tips for Parents & Guardians**

- Review our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1pJDPGOXueYFzt81Wzzv25-04_nuPi3seArJJkqm_d_4/edit) before granting consent.
- Ask your child’s school or esports center how they use Squid Academy.
- Encourage your child to use privacy settings and be mindful about sharing personal information.
