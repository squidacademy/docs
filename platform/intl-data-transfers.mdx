Squid Academy operates internationally. This means that your personal data may be transferred to and processed in countries outside of your own — including countries that may not have the same level of data protection as your home country.

This page summarizes how we handle cross-border transfers as described in Section 14 of our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1pJDPGOXueYFzt81Wzzv25-04_nuPi3seArJJkqm_d_4/edit) and Section 10 of our [<u>Data Processing Addendum</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit).

## **1. Where Your Data May Go**

- **Primary processing locations** – We store and process data in the regions where we (and our sub-processors) operate, which may include the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Asia-Pacific regions.
- **Third-party sub-processors** – Our [<u>Sub-processor List</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1hSsHISPyzidVjqRFjI2EwKUCX3lrMDW5LtjxLhJ1zVs/edit) includes details of vendors that may process personal data internationally.

## **2. How We Protect Your Data During Transfers**

When personal data is transferred across borders, we implement safeguards that meet applicable legal requirements, such as:

### **Adequacy Decisions**

- Transfers from the EU/EEA, UK, or Switzerland to countries recognized by the European Commission (or UK Government) as having adequate protection.

### **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)**

- For transfers to countries without an adequacy decision, we use the European Commission’s SCCs or the UK International Data Transfer Addendum as appropriate.

### **Supplementary Measures**

- Technical measures such as encryption in transit and at rest.
- Access controls ensuring only authorized personnel can access the data.
- Organizational measures such as staff training and vendor due diligence.

### **Transfer Impact Assessments (TIAs)**

- We assess the legal and practical risks of each transfer, and document these assessments.

## **3. Transfers Initiated by Your Organization**

If your organization (school, university, or esports center) uses our services from outside the EU/EEA/UK, it is responsible for ensuring that its own data transfers to us comply with applicable laws.

## **4. Your Rights**

You can request:

- A copy of the SCCs or other applicable transfer mechanism.
- Details of the countries where your personal data has been processed.

## **5. Updates**
