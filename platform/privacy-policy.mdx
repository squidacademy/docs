## **1. Who We Are & Scope**

This Privacy Policy explains how Squid Academy Ltd (“Squid”, “we”, “us”) collects, uses, shares, and protects personal information across our websites, web apps, and services (collectively, the “Services”). It works together with our [<u>Terms & Conditions</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1naMWUBeGi99rmMptIY-oXLlr9BmTGDXIoFk2qQ-_p4A/edit) and our [<u>Data Processing Addendum</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit) (DPA) for Organization customers.

**Contact:** [<u>privacy@squid.gg</u>](mailto:privacy@squid.gg).

## **2. How This Policy Relates To Our T&Cs & DPA**

- For Public Users (people who create an account directly with us): Squid is the controller for your core account data; this Privacy Policy applies.
- For Organization‑provisioned users (students, teachers, staff invited by a school, university, esports center, etc.): the Organization is the controller and Squid is the processor/service provider under the DPA; this Privacy Policy should be read together with the DPA and your Organization’s privacy notices.

If the T&Cs and this Privacy Policy ever conflict on Organization data processing, the DPA prevails as to processing on the Organization’s behalf.

## **3. Who May Use The Services** (children and students)

- **Public accounts:** Under‑13 sign‑ups are not permitted. Public Users must be 13\+.
- **Organization‑provisioned minors:** Organizations must verify age and obtain/retain verifiable parental/guardian consent where required (e.g., COPPA; India DPDP under 18; Thailand PDPA).

Guidance for obtaining and verifying parental consent is available in our [<u>Parental Consent Guide</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/16g2ikC0mSpiT5Lhsh_yCTMe8tVgxJUPPmHqvQdloq8Y/edit).

- We do not sell personal data, profile minors for advertising, or use Organization‑provisioned minors’ data for cross‑context behavioral ads.

## **4. What We Collect**

### **4.1 Information you provide**

- Account and profile data (e.g., name, email, role/organization), classroom/team participation, coursework and tournament participation, and support requests.

### **4.2 Data we collect automatically**

- Technical telemetry (e.g., login logs, timestamps) and security/operations data necessary to run the Services.

### **4.3 Information from others**

- If you sign in via a third‑party identity provider (e.g., Google/Apple) or you are invited by an Organization, we may receive limited account/roster information consistent with your settings and the Organization’s instructions.

### **4.4 Special categories and payment data**

- We do not intend to collect special‑category data (e.g., health, biometrics). Please do not submit it unless necessary for educational use and permitted by law.
- We do not process payment card data for the Services; payments are handled by third‑party payment processors unless expressly stated in an Order.

## **5. Why We Use Your Information** (purposes)

We use personal information to:

- Provide the Services (user authentication, class/team management, course delivery, progress/tournament operations, support, and security).
- Maintain and improve the Services using aggregated/de-identified usage metrics; we do not attempt to re‑identify de‑identified data.
- Comply with law and enforce our T&Cs; respond to lawful requests (with safeguards).

### **AI/ML model training**

We do not use Controller Personal Data (Organization‑provided data) to train, retrain, or fine‑tune generalized AI/ML models for unrelated product development, unless on the Organization’s documented instructions.

## **6. Cookies & Similar Tech**

Right now we use only essential session cookies for authentication and core functions. If we later add analytics or non‑essential cookies, we’ll implement a compliant consent mechanism.

## **7. Sharing Your Information**

We share personal information with:

- Sub‑processors/service providers that help us host, support, secure, and deliver the Services; we maintain a [<u>Sub‑processor List</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1hSsHISPyzidVjqRFjI2EwKUCX3lrMDW5LtjxLhJ1zVs/edit) and give 30 days’ advance notice of changes, with an emergency replacement carve‑out and objection/termination rights as set out in the DPA.
- Authorities when legally required (we notify and limit disclosure where possible).
- **Business transfers.** If we are involved in a reorganization (e.g., merger, acquisition, or sale of assets), personal information may transfer as part of the transaction; we will continue to protect it and will provide notice of any material changes to this Policy.

**No sale/sharing for ads:** When acting as a processor/service provider, we do not sell or share personal information or use it for cross‑context behavioral advertising; our US state privacy commitments are spelled out in the DPA and T&Cs.

## **8. International Data Transfers**

We use approved safeguards for cross‑border transfers, including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) (Module 2/3 as applicable) and the UK Addendum/IDTA; we also support transfer impact assessments and supplementary measures where needed. See [<u>DPA</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit) Section 6 and Annex IV.

## **9. Security**

We maintain [<u>appropriate technical and organizational measures</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1vyd27JAHAeSYlxSRP0gG9LyMicI6uBO7YjfjQfHYU6k/edit) (access controls, encryption in transit/at rest, secure development and change management, monitoring, backups/DR, incident response). A summary of our TOMs is in Annex II of the [<u>DPA</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1IXgzc8vsrTkkPtnwghZ2pHGoR_ZyCeKdo2db0m7dNsw/edit).

If we become aware of a confirmed [<u>Security Incident</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1vyd27JAHAeSYlxSRP0gG9LyMicI6uBO7YjfjQfHYU6k/edit) affecting Organization data, we will notify the impacted customer without undue delay (and where GDPR applies, where feasible within 72 hours, EEA 1 month; US states 45 days \+ permissible extension), and cooperate on remediation.

## **10. Retention**

We keep personal information only as long as needed for the purposes above or as required by law. Upon termination/expiry, we’ll delete or return Organization personal data on written instruction and delete existing copies within 35 days; we can provide written deletion confirmation.

For details, see our [<u>Data Retention & Deletion Schedule</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/u/6/d/1vFMrCnA-rl3LgBMuAifFAh2rFAmHFjWgtJzmT-4q4TA/edit).
